<h1>About the Evalutation Version</h1>

In order to use the Qt Jambi Evaluation version, you need the
evaluation key, which is sent by email when you register to evaluate
Qt Jambi. If you have not received an eveluation key, please contact
<a href="mailto:sales@trolltech.com">sales@trolltech.com</a>.

<p>
The key is entered in the installer on Windows. On Mac OS X and Linux,
it is entered by running the <tt>binpatch</tt> application, which is
located in the Qt Jambi installation directory.
<p>
A general Qt Jambi readme is available in the installation directory:
<a href="readme.html">readme.html</a>.
<p>
For running Qt Jambi applications, please refer to the "Alternate way of loading native libraries", in the installation document.
