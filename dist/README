Qt Jambi
========

Qt Jambi is the Qt library made available to Java. 

Please make sure you read and understand the LICENSE file.


Requirements
------------

Qt Jambi requires Java 1.5 or later to be installed and available in
your PATH for examples to run.


Running the Launcher
--------------------

The Qt Jambi package comes prebuilt for Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows. To run the Examples/Demo launcher, run the:

Windows:
	qtjambi.exe

Linux/Mac OS X:
	qtjambi.sh

file from the root directory. This will verify your virtual machine
version and set the correct environment for running Qt Jambi
applications.


Running Qt Designer
-------------------

To run the Qt Designer with the Qt Jambi language and Qt Jambi custom
widget plugins one has to run the designer.bat or designer.sh file in
the jambi install directory. In order for Qt Designer to find your
java installation you may be required to set JAVADIR prior to
running Qt Designer. 


Running Eclipse with the Qt Designer plugin
-------------------------------------------

To run Eclipse with the Qt Designer plugin you are required to set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the $JAMBI_INSTALL_DIR/lib. 


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is provided in doc/html with the
com/trolltech/qt/qtjambi-index.html as the main index file. For easy 
access to the documentation run the launcher and click the 
"Documentation" button which will open the documentation in your preferred browser.


Manually launching Qt Jambi applications
----------------------------------------

If you want to manually run Qt Jambi you need to set your CLASSPATH
environment variable to include the qtjambi.jar file to get access to
the library. To run the examples or launcher, you also need include the
Qt Jambi root directory in the CLASSPATH.

In addition to this, you need to set the correct environment for Qt
Jambi to find the native libraries. 

Windows:
	Set the PATH environment variable to include the bin directory
	in the Qt Jambi directory.

Linux:
	Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the
	lib directory in the Qt Jambi directory.

Mac OS X:
	Set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the
	lib directory in the Qt Jambi directory.


Platform Notes
--------------

Mac OS X: 
    It is necessary to pass the argument -XstartOnFirstThread to the
    java executable when running a Qt Jambi application. 

Linux:
    On 64 bit Ubuntu installations you need to install the ia32-sun-java5-bin
    package and put /usr/lib/jvm/ia32-java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.06/jre/bin into your
    PATH environment variable.
    The final version will of course ship with sources, so you can compile and
    run it with the full 64 bit version of java.

Running the Qt Jambi Generator
------------------------------

There is an example included on how to use the Qt Jambi Generator
available in the generator_example directory in the Qt Jambi
directory.
