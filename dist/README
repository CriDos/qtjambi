Qt Jambi
========

Qt Jambi is the Qt library made available to Java. 

Please make sure you read and understand the LICENSE file.

If you have problems installing, please consult the trouble shooting
section in the Qt Jambi install document
(http://doc.trolltech.com/qtjambi/com/trolltech/qt/qtjambi-installation.html).

Requirements
------------

Qt Jambi requires Java 1.5 or later to be installed and available in
your PATH for examples to run.


Running the Launcher
--------------------

The Qt Jambi package comes prebuilt for Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows. To run the Examples/Demo launcher, run the:

Windows:
	qtjambi.exe

Linux/Mac OS X:
	qtjambi.sh

file from the root directory. This will verify your virtual machine
version and set the correct environment for running Qt Jambi
applications.

If you have downloaded a source package, these files are not
available. After building Qt Jambi, you can run the launcher manually:

java com.trolltech.launcher.Launcher

Running Qt Designer
-------------------

To run the Qt Designer with the Qt Jambi language and Qt Jambi custom
widget plugins one has to run the designer.bat or designer.sh file in
the Jambi install directory. In order for Qt Designer to find your
java installation you may be required to set JAVADIR prior to
running Qt Designer. 


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is provided in doc/html with the
com/trolltech/qt/qtjambi-index.html as the main index file. For easy 
access to the documentation run the launcher and click the 
"Documentation" button which will open the documentation in your preferred browser.


Manually launching Qt Jambi applications
----------------------------------------

Unless you have downloaded a source package, you need the qtjambi.jar
file, which will be located in the Qt Jambi root directory. Set the
CLASSPATH environment variable to include qtjambi.jar to get access to
the library.

The next step is to include the Qt Jambi root directory in the
CLASSPATH. If you don't want to run the examples or launcher, this
step is optional unless you have a source package.

In the standard package structure, Qt Jambi will automatically locate
the native libraries. For other directory structures, you need to set
the correct environment for Qt Jambi to find the native libraries.

Windows:
	Set the PATH environment variable to include the bin directory
	in the Qt Jambi directory.

Linux:
	Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the
	lib directory in the Qt Jambi directory.

Mac OS X:
	Set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the
	lib directory in the Qt Jambi directory.

Finally, the QT_PLUGIN_PATH variable must contain the path to the
plugins directory in the Qt Jambi directory.

Platform Notes
--------------

Mac OS X: 
    It is necessary to pass the argument -XstartOnFirstThread to the
    java executable when running a Qt Jambi application. 


Running the Qt Jambi Generator
------------------------------

There is an example included on how to use the Qt Jambi Generator
available in the generator_example directory in the Qt Jambi
directory.
