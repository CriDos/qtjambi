This is list of known issues for Qt Jambi. 

 - The tr() method in QObject is currently only a dummy implementation
   and will always return you an exact copy of the string you pass in.
   Internationalization support has not been implemented yet in Qt 
   Jambi.

 - When calling QObject::disconnect() from the C++ side and passing 0
   arguments Qt Jambi will not disconnect according to the documentation.

 - QObject construction is currently mutex locked to allow
   construction for arbitrary threads simultaneously. This is because of
   an issue in Qt 4.1.3 that has been fixed for Qt 4.2 so the final
   version of Qt Jambi will not have this problem.

 - If the virtual machine on Mac OS X is executed without passing the
   command line argument -XstartOnFirstThread the application will crash
   shortly after startup. See that qtjambi.sh file for how to launch
   the virtual machine.

 - With JRE 1.6, main(String[]) is no longer called from the process'
   main thread. This will cause the process to issue a warning on
   application shutdown: "QObject::killTimer: timers cannot be stopped
   from another thread". We are looking into solutions for this.
   

This is a list of known issues for the Qt Jambi Eclipse integration:

 - Eclipse may issue an error on shutdown if Qt Designer integration is 
   activated.

 - Using the Eclipse Integration for Qt Jambi on KDE may cause problems
   if you are using KDE styles for GTK applications. In order to use
   the integration on KDE you must turn off this feature in your settings.

 - Keyboard shortcuts may not always work as expected.
