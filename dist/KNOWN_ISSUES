This is list of known issues for Qt Jambi. 

 - If you start a main window application from the demo launcher on Mac OS X, 
   and then close the window, the menu bar may not be properly removed. If
   you click on one of the menus, the application will crash.

 - The tr() method in QObject is currently only a dummy implementation
   and will always return you an exact copy of the string you pass in.
   Internationalization support has not been implemented yet in Qt 
   Jambi.

 - If the virtual machine on Mac OS X is executed without passing the
   command line argument -XstartOnFirstThread the application will crash
   shortly after startup. See that qtjambi.sh file for how to launch
   the virtual machine.

 - With JRE 1.6, main(String[]) is no longer called from the process'
   main thread. This will cause the process to issue a warning on
   application shutdown: "QObject::killTimer: timers cannot be stopped
   from another thread". We are looking into solutions for this.

 - Qt Jambi does currently not load plugins automatically unless the user
   specifies the environment variable QT_PLUGIN_PATH to be
   $JAMBI_INSTALL_DIR/plugins   

This is a list of known issues for the Qt Jambi Eclipse integration:

 - Eclipse may issue an error on shutdown if Qt Designer integration is 
   activated.

 - Using the Eclipse Integration for Qt Jambi on KDE may cause problems
   if you are using KDE styles for GTK applications. In order to use
   the integration on KDE you must turn off this feature in your settings.
