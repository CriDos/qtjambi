About the Evalutation Version
-----------------------------

In order to properly run Qt Jambi Applications the binaries have to
patched with the evaluation key. For windows this is done by the
installer. For Mac OS X and Linux this is done by the various scripts,
like qtjambi.sh. It can also be done explicitly by running the
binpatch application supplied in the qtjambi package.
