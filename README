How to build....

1. Generate the code.
 - cd into generator
 - build it (preferably in release as its a lot faster
 - run it. Default settings should be fine

1.5 Go to the directory viewing //depot/research/main/java/. Set the JAVADIR
    environment variable to indicate the directory where the Java SDK is installed.	

2. Run qmake -r && make from the java directory to build Juic, QtGui wrapper and QtCore wrapper.

3. Generate java files with Juic. Easiest thing is set CLASSPATH env var to point
   to the root of the generated Java files (starts with com/trolltech/... and should
   be your current directory...). Run 
	juic -cp .
   Note that the classpath should be the parent directory of com/trolltech, i.e. 
   the directory viewing //depot/research/main/java/.

4. Compile the java files by doing:
   javac @java_files

5. Linux: Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH include the ./lib directory.
    MacOS: Set your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH include the ./lib directory.
    Win32: Set your PATH include the .\lib directory.

5. You're all set. Try running for instance:
   java com.trolltech.demos.TextEdit or 
   java com.trolltech.examples.Tetrix
  
   For a complete list of executable stuff look in:
	com/trolltech/tests
	com/trolltech/examples
	com/trolltech/demos

6. Troubleshooting:
   * If you only have Qt built in debug you need to run jambi in debug
     too. This is done by starting the virtual machine with the option:
     -Dcom.trolltech.qt.debug=true.

   * If you get load issues, try to run jambi with
     -Dcom.trolltech.qt.verbose-loading=true to see which library fails


To compile/run the launcher:

1. javac com\trolltech\launcher\*.java

2. java com.trolltech.launcher.Launcher


How to build the SQL package....

1. Do the "How to build..." steps earlier in this file

2. Generate the code
 - cd into generator
 - run it with command line arguments "tests/sql.h" and "build_sql.txt"

3. Compile the code
 - cd into //depot/research/main/java/qtjambi_sql
 - qmake && make

4. Compile the Java code
 - cd into //depot/research/main/java/com/trolltech/qt/sql (not really in the depot, but if it were this would be the path)
 - javac *.java

5. Also build example in com/trolltech/examples (just javac *.java)
 - e.g. java com.trolltech.examples.CachedTable 

How to build the opengl package....

1. Do the "How to build..." steps earlier in this file

2. Generate the code
 - cd into generator
 - run it with command line arguments "tests/opengl.h" and "build_opengl.txt"

3. Compile the code
 - cd into //depot/research/main/java/qtjambi_opengl
 - qmake && make

4. Compile the Java code
 - cd into //depot/research/main/java/com/trolltech/qt/opengl
 - % javac *.java

5. Download JOGL package from Sun and install it (make sure the jar is in your classpath)

6. Compile and run the opengl demo
 - cd into //depot/research/main/java/com/trolltech/demos
 - % javac HelloGL.java
 - % java com.trolltech.demos.HelloGL

-
Enjoy
