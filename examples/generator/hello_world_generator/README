Simple Hello World example

This is a simple hello world example to show the most basic use of the qtjambi generator.
The example shows how to transfer a Qt C++ Widget including some classes to a it's
java equivalents.

Prerequisites:
You must compile QtJambi from source to be able to run this example. This is done issuing
ant on the root directory of your source installation.

You must then set the environment variable JAMBIDIR to this root path. Then set 
PATH=$PATH:$JAMBIDIR/generator, or PATH=%PATH%;%JAMBIDIR%\generator\release if you are
running on Windows.

Stages:

1) Have a look in the directory src. Here you will find the C++ sources of the widget. It
is possible to create a binary out of these sources issuing qmake and make in the directory
makefiles. The binary will end up in a new directory bin.

2) Now, in the jambi sub directory you will find a directory structure suitable for building
a qtjambi widget. The scripts directory contains the generator build files (build.xml, 
pro file, typesystem file and an include file global.h). In this directory you can issue the
command "ant" to start the build. This should produce a file 
jambi/target/test-<platform>-<compiler>-<qt-version>.jar

3) In the java directory you will find a TestJava.java. It corresponds mainly to src/main.cpp.
If you adjust the testit.sh with the correct name of qtjambi.jar and test.jar, and rework it
to a bat file if you are working on Windows, you should be able to compile and launch the
java version of the widget.
