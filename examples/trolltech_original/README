The generator example is an example that illustrates how to make use
of the Qt Jambi Generator

To run the generator example, simply run 'ant' on the
'build_generator_example.xml' file in the root directory. This will
create a custom platform .jar file which includes the native libraries
which should be used when deploying the generator example application.
