--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

The packaging script uses QSA so you'll need a qsa command line
runner. A prebuilt version of this is located in

  //depot/private/gunnar/qsengine_win32
  //depot/private/gunnar/qsengine_linux
  //depot/private/gunnar/qsengine_mac

If you want to build manually, do so by building qsa in
//depot/research/qsa/quickport and building the executable in
//depot/research/qsa/quickport/tests/qsengine

You also need a version of qdoc3 in your path. 

You need cygwin on windows, including zip.

Building the Qt package

 - Fetch the Qt source package for the version you intend to build against.

 - Apply patches: 
   * 221022, painting bug in itemviews, visible in the imageviewer.
   * 222044, clipping bug on mac, very visible in the demo.
   * 222336, Run as foreground process on mac.
   * Copy src/gui/painting/qprinter.cpp from 4.1.4 branch to support no-qt3support

 - Configure using:
    Mac OS X: ./configure -no-qt3support -universal -release -no-rpath -fast -shared -no-framework -prefix $(pwd)
    Windows: configure -no-qt3support -release -fast -shared -no-dsp -no-vcproj
    Linux: ./configure -no-qt3support -fast -release -no-rpath -fast -shared

 - Qt 4.1.3 is missing some symbols when compiled without Qt 3 support. To
   fix this, copy qprinter.cpp from Qt 4.1 depot into the Qt 4.1.3 package.
    
 - Make using:
    make sub-src sub-tools

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the Qt Jambi package

 - execute qsengine as follows
   qsengine $PATH_TO_DEPOT/private/gunnar/utils.qs mkdist.qs -args --verbose

 - If you're adventurous, put add a '--teambuilder' on the commandline to
   qsengine to make use of teambuilder if present on the system you're
   building on.

 - qsengine will check a number of dependencies, mainly cygwin and
   commong shell-tools. If these are not present, qsengine will throw
   an exception. Just update your system and try again.

 - The resulting package will be in
     Linux/Mac: /tmp/package-builder/qtjambi-preview.tar.gz
     Windows: d:/tmp/package-builder/qtjambi-preview.zip
