To run the generator example, simply execute the generator_example
script:

Windows:
    generator_example.bat

Linux and Mac OS X: 
    generator_example.sh

This will go through the required steps of executing the generator
with the correct environment set up, then build the native libraries
and the java source files required by the example. See the script
files for details in the individual steps.

Please note that you need an actual Qt version installed with qmake
and the Qt header files for the generator example to work. You also
need the Java compiler, javac,  in your path.

On Mac OS X this example requires that the Qt version you are
compiling against is a release version of the Qt source package,
configure without frameworks.
