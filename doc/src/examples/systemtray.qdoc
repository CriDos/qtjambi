    \title System Tray Icon Example

    The System Tray Icon example shows how to add an icon with a menu
    and popup messages, to a desktop environment's system tray.

    Modern operating systems usually provide a special area on the
    desktop, called the system tray or notification area, where
    long-running applications can display icons and short messages.

    \section1 SystemTrayExample Class Implementation

    The SystemTrayExample class extends QWidget and provides an editor
    for the system tray icon.

    \quotefromfile SystemTrayExample.java
    \skipto class SystemTrayExample
    \printuntil iconCombo

    The editor enables the user to modify the message title, edit the
    actual message and choose the message type. The information
    display will contain status messages for the icon. In addition,
    the user can select an icon of the preferred size.

    When constructing the editor widget, we first check if the system
    tray is available on the user's desktop. If it is not, we show a
    message to the user:

    \skipto public SystemTrayExample()
    \printuntil warning
    \printuntil tray unavailable

    The QMessageBox class provides a modal dialog with a short
    message, an icon, and buttons laid out depending on the current
    style. It supports four severity levels: "Question",
    "Information", "Warning" and "Critical". The easiest way to pop up
    a message box in Qt is to call one of the associated static
    methods, e.g. \l
    {QMessageBox::warning()}{QMessageBox.warning()}.

    \skipto new QMenu
    \printuntil aboutToShow

    Then we create the menu that will appear when right-clicking over
    the icon in the system tray. The QMenu class provides a menu
    widget for use in menu bars, context menus, and other popup
    menus. We use the menu's \l {QMenu::aboutToShow()}{aboutToShow()}
    signal to ensure that the menu is updated when it is shown. We
    will come back to the editor's \c updateMenu() method later on.

    A menu consists of a list of action items, i.e., a collection of
    QAction objects:

    \skipto toggleVisibilityAction
    \printuntil addAction(quitAction)

    The purpose of the various actions in our menu, is to control the
    appearance of the editor widget: Before we add each action to the
    menu, we connect their \l {QAction::triggered()}{triggered()}
    signal to the appropiate methods of the editor widget. The \l
    {QWidget::showNormal()}{showNormal()}, \l
    {QWidget::showMinimized()}{showMinimized()}, \l
    {QWidget::showMaximized()}{showMaximized()} and \l
    {QWidget::close()}{close()} methods are inherited from QWidget,
    while the \c toggleVisibility() method is specific to this
    example and simply hides or shows the editor depending on its
    current state.

    \skipto trayIcon
    \printuntil trayIcon.show()

    It is the QSystemTrayIcon class that actually provides the icon in
    the system tray. When we create our icon, we first set its tooltip
    to be the message title and ensure that our newly created menu
    appears as the icon's context menu.

    To provide respons to user interaction, we then connect the icon's
    \l {QSystemTrayIcon::activated()}{activated()} and \l
    {QSystemTrayIcon::messageClicked()}{messageClicked()} signals to
    the editor's \c activated() and \c balloonClicked() methods,
    respectively. Before we show the icon, we also choose its initial
    size using the editor's \c changeIcon() method. We will take a
    look at the editor's methods shortly.

    \skipto titleLabel
    \printuntil iconCombo.activatedIndex

    \skipto QGridLayout
    \printuntil }

    Finally, we create the editor's various window elements and use a
    QGridLayout to organize them. The QGridLayout class takes the
    space made available to it, divides it up into rows and columns,
    and puts each widget it manages into the correct cell.

    \skipto closeEvent
    \printuntil }

    It is important to note that QObject subclasses normally have a
    lifetime beyond what is visible to the garbage collector. To
    ensure that such a object is deleted, you must either assign the
    object to a parent (child widgets are automatically disposed of by
    their parents upon destruction) or call the \c dispose() method
    explicitly.

    Since we use the QSystemTrayIcon class (which is a QObject
    subclass) without giving our icon a parent, we must reimplement
    QWidget's \l {QWidget::closeEvent()}{closeEvent()} method to
    dispose the icon when the application is terminated.

    \skipto updateMenu
    \printuntil }

    The \c updateMenu() method is called whenever the system tray
    icon's context menu is about to be shown, i.e. when the user
    right-clicks the icon in the system tray. The method simply
    checks whether the editor widget is currently visible or not, and
    update the menu accordingly.

    \skipto toggleVisibility
    \printuntil }

    The \c toggleVisibility() method is called whenever the user
    chooses \gui Hide or \gui Show in the context menu, and use the \l
    {QWidget::hide()}{hide()} and \l {QWidget::show()}{show()}
    methods inherited from QWidget to control the appearance of the
    editor widget.

    \skipto showMessage
    \printline showMessage
    \skipto macVersion
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    The \c showMessage() method is called whenever the user presses
    the \gui {Balloon message} button. Note that balloon tips are not
    supported on Mac OS X. On any other platform, we create a message
    icon (i.e., the icon that is shown next to the message title when
    a balloon message is displayed), show the message and update the
    icon's tooltip.

    \skipto balloonClicked
    \printuntil }

    The \c balloonClicked() method is called whenever the user
    clicks the system tray icon's message, and simply append a status
    message to the information display in the editor.

    \skipto activated
    \printuntil }

    Whenever the user activates the system tray icon, e.g., by
    clicking it, the icon's \l
    {QSystemTrayIcon::activated()}{activated()} signal is emitted and
    the editor's \c activated() method is called (due to the
    connection we created in the constructor).  The \c activated()
    method determines the reason the icon was activated and derives
    a corresponding message that it append to the information display
    in the editor.

    \skipto changeIcon
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    The \c changeIcon() method is used to change the icon pixmap,
    and is called whenever the user select a different size for the
    system tray icon.

    \quotefromfile SystemTrayExample.java
    \skipto main
    \printuntil }
    \skipto REMOVE-END
    \skipto }
    \printuntil }

    Finally, we provide a \c main() method to create and show the
    editor widget when the example is run.
